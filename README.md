This software is a tool that calculates the percentage drop or rise of your favorite cryptocurrency based on the current price. It helps you determine how much to place for a buy order. It's that simple.

This is also my first practice project using SvelteKit, deployed at [https://crypto.solitudo.dev/](https://crypto.solitudo.dev/). You can fork it, add your favortie coin and deploy it on Cloudflare Workers.
